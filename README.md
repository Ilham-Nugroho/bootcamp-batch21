1. make sure to use "npm install" on your terminal to install all the required packages
2. .env have the environment that I use. I didn't put it in .gitignore to make it easier to use, however you can change it the way you see fit.
3. I use mongoose as my database
4. the Server is running on localhost:3000. 
5. Open localhost:3000 on your web page and you can use the web app the way you asked it for task number 4.
